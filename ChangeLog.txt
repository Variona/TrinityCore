Added a few new custom gossips.

Nerfed the level of Stormwind City Guards (68), Orgrimmar Grunt(3296 & 31416), Kor'kron Overseer (36213),
	Bluffwatcher (3084), Silvermoon City Guardian (16222), Ironforge Guard (5595), Darnassus Sentinel (4262),
	and Exodar Peacekeeper (16733) | Now level 65 was 75.

Tweaked quite a few HP / damage values for various monsters / bosses in Molten Core & Zul'gurub.

Edited the Random Enchant Script (Henceforth called Warforged) | Added a 5th possible bonus. Reduced the increased chance
	that Rare / Epic items used to give. Rares now give a 20% extra chance per roll and Epics give a 50% extra bonus. 
	Was, Rare 200% and Epic 300%. Will tweak if needed in the future.

	Developer note:
		The item was too strong for a level 21 item. I tried reducing the proc rate which helped but in the end 
		nerfing the total amount it absorbs is the most effective way to get it back around where it should be.


-----2019/08/15-----

Reduced the rate of rested experience gained.

Crusader Strike (35395) | Reduced damage done from 100% weapon damage to 75%. And mana cost is 1% was 5%.
	Developer Note:
		This change is made to put Crusader Strike's damage back to what it is in default 3.3.5. A long time ago
		it was buffed to 100%. As the ability can be gained at level 20 by all Paladins and doesn't require
		any talent points in Retribution as before it feels justified to nerf it back to its original state.
		It is now a cheaper spell to cast as mana cost shouldn't be a huge factor in a Paladin's decision making.

	has been buffed.

Added Imbued Light Crossbow (90659), Imbued Fine Light Crossbow (90660), and Imbued Heavy Crossbow (90661).
	They are Uncommon (Green) Crossbows meant to be sold by a vendor. Currently being sold by Marda Weller (1287)
	in Stormwind. Will be adding another vendor for the Horde later.
	
Fixed up the old random enchantment script. Now only affects Uncommon+ items and also doesn't affect non weapon
	or non armor items. Not all enchants are created equal! Good luck and may RNGesus be with you.
	
Fixed various enchantment ids that were invalid.
	
Added waypoints for some of the Golem Protectors (190108).

-----2019/07/18-----

Lowered the amount of epics sold on the AH substantially and the amount of rare items were reduced moderately.

-----2019/07/14-----

Nerfed all extra exp gained from killing higher level monsters than you. 
	Developer note: The goal of the extra experience is to both to incentivize trying to kill hard monsters and to
		add a system that just makes sense logically. If you kill a monster far stronger than you you should 
		recieve ample experience as a reward. However I noticed that it wasn't terribly hard to kill monsters
		upwards of 30 levels higher without much challenge. Thus I've reduced the amount of experience gained over 
		all brackets. Will keep an eye on it and adjust more if needed.
