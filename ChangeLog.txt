New NPC Gonak Thrul'zar (190113) | Repair vendor

Nerfed Spell Hardcore Mode | Now only grants 50% extra attack power. Spell power is the same.

			performance and will make tweaks if necessary.

Nerfed Corrupted Quel'dorei Crest | Absorbs 300 + 1 per level down from 500 flat.
	Developer note:
		The item was too strong for a level 21 item. I tried reducing the proc rate which helped but in the end 
		nerfing the total amount it absorbs is the most effective way to get it back around where it should be.


-----2019/08/15-----

Crusader Strike (35395) | Reduced damage done from 100% weapon damage to 75%. And mana cost is 1% was 5%.
	Developer Note:
		This change is made to put Crusader Strike's damage back to what it is in default 3.3.5. A long time ago
		it was buffed to 100%. As the ability can be gained at level 20 by all Paladins and doesn't require
		any talent points in Retribution as before it feels justified to nerf it back to its original state.
		It is now a cheaper spell to cast as mana cost shouldn't be a huge factor in a Paladin's decision making.

	has been buffed.

	They are Uncommon (Green) Crossbows meant to be sold by a vendor. Currently being sold by Marda Weller (1287)
	in Stormwind. Will be adding another vendor for the Horde later.
	
Fixed up the old random enchantment script. Now only affects Uncommon+ items and also doesn't affect non weapon
	or non armor items. Not all enchants are created equal! Good luck and may RNGesus be with you.
	
Fixed various enchantment ids that were invalid.
	
Added waypoints for some of the Golem Protectors (190108).

-----2019/07/18-----

Lowered the amount of epics sold on the AH substantially and the amount of rare items were reduced moderately.
	Developer Note:

-----2019/07/14-----

Nerfed all extra exp gained from killing higher level monsters than you. 
	Developer note: The goal of the extra experience is to both to incentivize trying to kill hard monsters and to
		add a system that just makes sense logically. If you kill a monster far stronger than you you should 
		recieve ample experience as a reward. However I noticed that it wasn't terribly hard to kill monsters
		upwards of 30 levels higher without much challenge. Thus I've reduced the amount of experience gained over 
		all brackets. Will keep an eye on it and adjust more if needed.
