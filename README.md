Basics of this server.

3.3.5 - Wrath of the Lich King

Experience rates are 1x but experience required for every level is different. 1-20 is roughly the same but beyond that levels require more. The amount needed slowly grows the closer you are to level 80.

There is no real level cap. (255 Hardcap but 86 softcap) The only limit is lack of experience to level up.

Custom items, quests, spells, and more. These are all fairly blizzlike and nothing crazy like a funserver would be.

Transmogrification is available and an AH bot.

There isn't really an population to speak of as this is a personal server that only my friends has access to. 

This is more of a learning experience for myself. To see how much I can add / change within reason.
